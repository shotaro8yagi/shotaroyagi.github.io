            <p>What <i>is</i> project anyway?</p>
            <p>We all think we know what a project is, until we try to explain it without using managerial words. I won't dig too deeply into <a href="https://ptp.voyage/journal/1/#selforganizingprojects">this illusion</a> here, but it is useful to notice how quickly our language defaults to management concepts.</p>
            <p>Goal, deadline, members...these are not necessary. They are rather <i>how</i> we want to manage the project. If you want to use will to explain projects, but take a moment to take a look at this:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
              <p>
                ...the faculty of the Will was unknown to Greek antiquity and was discovered as a result of experiences about which we hear next to nothing before the first century of the Christian era.
              </p>
              <footer>—Arendt, H. (1978). The life of the mind (Vol. 2, Willing). Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. p.3</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Hannah Arendt is pointing out that the concept of <i>will</i> wasn't known until early Christianity. In other words, human <i>will</i> is a historical construct, not a natural fact.</p>
            <p>Management science is full of such concepts that are treated as self-evident, even when they are underdefined. That is why we (practice theorists etc.) draw upon philosophy and sociology to articulate what is actually happening.</p>
            <p>There is simply so much we don't know. As Michael Tomasello writes:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
              <p>
                Humans putting their heads together in shared cooperative activities are thus the originators of human culture. <i>How and why all of this arose in human evolution is unknown</i>, but one speculation is that in the context of foraging for food (both hunting and gathering), humans were forced to become cooperators in a way that other primates were not.
              </p>
              <footer>—Tomasello, M. (2009). Why we cooperate. MIT Press. p.99</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Here, the renowned researcher on collaboration is saying that we actually don't know why we came to be collaborative. If he can be humble enough to admit that, why can't we do the same?</p>
            <p>I deliberately work as both a practitioner and a researcher, in order to articulate what practitioners already sense, and to give language to practices that are often felt but not named.</p>
